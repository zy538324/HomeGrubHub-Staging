          <p class="lead">At Home Grub Hub, we want you to enjoy confidence in your subscription. That’s why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users on their first subscription.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">1. Refund Eligibility</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Refunds are only available within the first 30 calendar days of your **initial paid subscription**.</li>
            <li>This applies whether you select a monthly or annual plan.</li>
            <li>After the first 30 days, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>Refunds are available once per customer and do not apply to renewals, upgrades, or second-time subscriptions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4">2. What’s Covered</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All paid plans: Home, Family, Pro, and Student are covered under this policy.</li>
            <li>If eligible, you will receive a full refund of your subscription fee to the original payment method, less any non-refundable transaction fees (e.g. Stripe).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4">3. After the 30-Day Period</h4>
          <p>After your first 30 days, your subscription will continue unless cancelled. You may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent further charges, but we do not issue partial or pro-rated refunds after this period.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">4. How to Request a Refund</h4>
          <p>If you are within your first 30 days and would like a refund, email us at <a href="mailto:support@homegrubhub.co.uk">support@homegrubhub.co.uk</a> with the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your registered email address</li>
            <liThe date of your original subscription</li>
            <liOptionally, a brief reason for your request (to help us improve)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Refunds are typically processed within 5–7 business days.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">5. Subscription Cancellations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings.</li>
            <li>Cancellation prevents future charges but does not trigger a refund unless within your first 30-day subscription.</li>
            <li>You will retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing cycle.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4">6. Abuse & Misuse</h4>
          <p>We reserve the right to deny refunds in cases of misuse, abuse of the refund policy, or violations of our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">7. Policy Changes</h4>
